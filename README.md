This project is a POC used for the start-up __LittleFarm__ to creates an educational toy exploiting augmented reality to sensibilize children on environmental values and respect of the planet by reconnecting them with the earth, the vegetable, the alive.

The objective of this project was to test the new __ARKit__ technology and successfully detect a 3D object with __OpenCV__ in order to place an augmented reality animation at its precise coordinates.


> This was one of my first project in iOS and also my first experience with Computer Vision
